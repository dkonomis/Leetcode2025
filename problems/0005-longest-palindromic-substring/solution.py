        Problem: 0005 - Longest Palindromic Substring.

        Approach:
        - Use dynamic programming to fill a table where dp[left][right] is True if s[left:right+1] is a palindrome.
        - Initialize all single-character and two-character substrings.
        - Expand to longer substrings from the bottom up.

        Time Complexity: O(n^2), where n is the length of the string.
        Space Complexity: O(n^2), for the dp table.
