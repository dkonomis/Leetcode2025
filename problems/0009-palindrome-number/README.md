## Problem

Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise.

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

Do not convert the integer to a string (for the follow-up).

### Example 1

**Input:**  
    x = 121  
**Output:**  
    true  
**Explanation:**  
    121 reads as 121 from left to right and right to left.

---

### Example 2

**Input:**  
    x = -121  
**Output:**  
    false  
**Explanation:**  
    From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121−. Therefore, it is not a palindrome.

---

### Example 3

**Input:**  
    x = 10  
**Output:**  
    false  
**Explanation:**  
    01 is not the same as 10.

## Constraints

- `-2³¹ <= x <= 2³¹ - 1`

### Follow-up

Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
