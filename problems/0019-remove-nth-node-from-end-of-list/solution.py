        Problem 0019 â€“ Remove Nth Node From End of List.

        Use two pointers to perform a one-pass solution.
        First, advance the `first` pointer n steps ahead.
        Then move both `first` and `second` until `first` reaches the end.
        At this point, `second` will be just before the node to remove.

        Time Complexity  : O(L), where L is the length of the linked list.
        Space Complexity : O(1), constant space used.
