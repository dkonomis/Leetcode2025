        Problem 0021 â€“ Merge Two Sorted Lists.

        Given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`,
        merge the two lists into one sorted list by splicing together their nodes.

        Return the head of the merged linked list.

        Approach:
        Use a dummy node as a placeholder for the result list head.
        Traverse both input lists simultaneously, and at each step, attach the smaller
        of the two current nodes to the result list.
        Advance the pointer in the list from which the node was taken.
        After one list is exhausted, append the rest of the other list.

        Time Complexity  : O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of the input lists.
        Space Complexity : O(1), excluding the output list which is constructed in-place.
