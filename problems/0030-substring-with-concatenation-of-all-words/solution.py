        0030. Substring with Concatenation of All Words

        Problem:
        Find all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation 
        of each word in words exactly once, in any order, and without any intervening characters.

        Approach:
        Use a sliding window of size len(words) * len(word). 
        For each offset in range(0, word_len), move the window in steps of word_len,
        counting valid words and checking against the expected frequency map.

        Time complexity: O(a + nâ‹…b), 
        where n = len(s), a = len(words), and b = len(words[0]).

        Space complexity: O(a + b).
