### Problem

Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.

A Sudoku solution must satisfy **all of the following rules**:

1. Each of the digits `1-9` must occur **exactly once** in each row.  
2. Each of the digits `1-9` must occur **exactly once** in each column.  
3. Each of the digits `1-9` must occur **exactly once** in each of the 9 `3x3` sub-boxes of the grid.

The `'.'` character indicates empty cells.

### Example 1

**Input:**  
board =  
[  
  ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],  
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],  
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],  
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],  
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],  
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],  
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],  
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],  
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]  
]

**Output:**  
[  
  ["5","3","4","6","7","8","9","1","2"],  
  ["6","7","2","1","9","5","3","4","8"],  
  ["1","9","8","3","4","2","5","6","7"],  
  ["8","5","9","7","6","1","4","2","3"],  
  ["4","2","6","8","5","3","7","9","1"],  
  ["7","1","3","9","2","4","8","5","6"],  
  ["9","6","1","5","3","7","2","8","4"],  
  ["2","8","7","4","1","9","6","3","5"],  
  ["3","4","5","2","8","6","1","7","9"]  
]

### Constraints

- `board.length == 9`  
- `board[i].length == 9`  
- `board[i][j]` is a digit `1-9` or `'.'`.  
- It is guaranteed that the input board has only **one solution**.
