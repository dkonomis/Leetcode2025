        51. N-Queens

        Summary:
        Place n queens on an n√ón chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.
        Return all distinct valid board configurations.

        Approach:
        - Use backtracking to build the solution row by row.
        - At each row, try placing a queen in any column that is not under attack.
        - Track columns, major diagonals, and minor diagonals that are already occupied.
        - When a full configuration is found, convert it to the required string format and add to result.

        Time complexity: O(n!), worst-case exponential due to recursive branching.
        Space complexity: O(n), for the current path and sets.
