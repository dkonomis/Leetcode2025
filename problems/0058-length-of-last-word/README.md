## Problem

Given a string `s` consisting of words and spaces, return the **length of the last word** in the string. A **word** is defined as a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

- If the last word does not exist, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

    Input: s = "Hello World"  
    Output: 5

**Example 2:**

    Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "  
    Output: 4

**Example 3:**

    Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"  
    Output: 6

**Constraints:**

- `1 ≤ s.length ≤ 10⁴`  
- `s` consists of only English letters and spaces `' '`.  
- There will be **at least one word** in `s`.
