## Problem

The set `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` contains `n!` unique permutations ordered lexicographically. Given two integers `n` and `k`, return the **kth permutation** in this order.

**Example 1:**

    Input: n = 3, k = 3  
    Output: "213"

**Example 2:**

    Input: n = 4, k = 9  
    Output: "2314"

**Example 3:**

    Input: n = 3, k = 1  
    Output: "123"

**Constraints:**

- `1 ≤ n ≤ 9`  
- `1 ≤ k ≤ n!`
