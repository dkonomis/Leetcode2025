## Problem

A robot is located at the top-left corner of an `m × n` grid. The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid.

Return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take.

**Example 1:**

    Input: m = 3, n = 7  
    Output: 28

**Example 2:**

    Input: m = 3, n = 2  
    Output: 3

**Constraints:**

- `1 ≤ m, n ≤ 100`  
- The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
