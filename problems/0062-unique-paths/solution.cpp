    Problem: 0062 - Unique Paths

    A robot is located at the top-left corner of an m Ã— n grid. The robot can only move
    either right or down at each step. Return the number of unique paths to reach the
    bottom-right corner of the grid.

    Approach:
    - Use bottom-up dynamic programming.
    - Let dp[i][j] store the number of unique paths to reach cell (i, j).
    - Initialize all cells in the first row and first column to 1 (only one way to reach them).
    - For all other cells, compute: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1].

    Time Complexity: O(m * n)
    Space Complexity: O(m * n), can be optimized to O(n) using 1D DP.
