        Problem: 0063 - Unique Paths II

        A robot is located at the top-left corner of an m Ã— n grid with obstacles.
        The robot can only move either right or down at any point. Return the number
        of unique paths to the bottom-right corner, avoiding obstacles.

        Approach:
        - Use dynamic programming.
        - Let dp[i][j] be the number of unique paths to reach cell (i, j).
        - If obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1, then dp[i][j] = 0 (cell is blocked).
        - Otherwise, dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1].
        - Handle the first row and column separately to account for early obstacles.

        Time complexity: O(m * n)
        Space complexity: O(m * n), can be optimized to O(n) if needed.
