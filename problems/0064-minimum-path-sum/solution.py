        Problem: 0064 - Minimum Path Sum

        Given an m Ã— n grid filled with non-negative integers, find a path from the top-left
        to the bottom-right corner which minimizes the sum of all numbers along the path.
        You may only move either down or right at any point.

        Approach:
        - Use dynamic programming to compute the minimum path sum to each cell.
        - Let dp[i][j] represent the minimum path sum to reach cell (i, j).
        - Initialize the first row and column based on cumulative sums.
        - For all other cells, dp[i][j] = grid[i][j] + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]).

        Time complexity: O(m * n)
        Space complexity: O(m * n), can be optimized to O(n) using 1D DP.
