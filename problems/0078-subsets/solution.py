        Problem: 0078 - Subsets

        Given a list of unique integers, return all possible subsets (the power set).

        Approach:
        - Use backtracking to explore each element's inclusion or exclusion.
        - At each recursive call, record the current subset path.
        - Recurse forward to explore adding more elements.
        - Always include a copy of the current path in the result.

        Time complexity: O(n Ã— 2^n), where n is the number of elements in nums.
        Space complexity: O(n) for the recursion call stack.
