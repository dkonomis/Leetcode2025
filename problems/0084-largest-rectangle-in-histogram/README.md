## Problem

Given an array of integers `heights` representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is `1`, return *the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram*.

---

### Example 1

**Input:**  
`heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]`  
**Output:**  
`10`  
**Explanation:**  
The largest rectangle is formed by bars 5 and 6 with a height of 5 and width of 2 → area = 5 × 2 = 10.

### Example 2

**Input:**  
`heights = [2,4]`  
**Output:**  
`4`

### Constraints

- `1 <= heights.length <= 10⁵`  
- `0 <= heights[i] <= 10⁴`
