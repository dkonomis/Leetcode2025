        Problem: 0085 - Maximal Rectangle

        Given a binary matrix filled with '0's and '1's, return the area of the largest rectangle containing only '1's.

        Approach:
        - For each row, treat it as the base of a histogram.
        - Maintain a running list of column heights: heights[j] is the number of consecutive 1s ending at row i in column j.
        - For each updated histogram row, apply the Largest Rectangle in Histogram algorithm (from Problem 0084).
        - Use a monotonic increasing stack to compute max area efficiently.

        Time complexity: O(m Ã— n), where m = number of rows, n = number of columns.
        Space complexity: O(n), for the histogram and stack.
