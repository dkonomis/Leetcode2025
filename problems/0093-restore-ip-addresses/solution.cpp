        Problem: 0093 - Restore IP Addresses

        Given a string s containing only digits, return all possible valid IP addresses
        that can be formed by inserting dots into s. A valid IP consists of four integers,
        each between 0 and 255, and no leading zeros unless the segment is exactly "0".

        Approach:
        - Use backtracking to try placing three dots to divide the string into 4 parts.
        - At each level, take 1 to 3 digits as a candidate segment.
        - Skip segments that are invalid: start with '0' but length > 1, or value > 255.
        - If we build 4 valid parts and use the entire string, add it to the result.

        Time complexity: O(1) â€” bounded since it's at most 3^4 combinations.
        Space complexity: O(1) auxiliary + O(R) result list where R is number of valid IPs.
