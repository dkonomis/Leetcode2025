        Problem: 0093 - Restore IP Addresses

        Given a string s containing only digits, return all possible valid IP addresses
        that can be formed by inserting dots into s. A valid IP consists of four integers,
        each between 0 and 255, and no leading zeros unless the segment is exactly "0".

        Approach:
        - Use backtracking to generate all segmentations of the string into 4 parts.
        - At each recursive step, try to take 1 to 3 digits as a segment.
        - Validate the segment: must be <= 255 and have no leading zero (unless it is "0").
        - Backtrack once we've either found a valid 4-part IP or exceeded constraints.

        Time complexity: O(1) â€” worst case is bounded since 4 segments of up to 3 digits.
        Space complexity: O(1) auxiliary + O(R) result list where R is number of valid IPs.
