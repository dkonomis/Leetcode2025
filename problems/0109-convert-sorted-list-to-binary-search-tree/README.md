# 0109. Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree

**Difficulty**: Medium  
**Link**: [LeetCode 109](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-list-to-binary-search-tree/)

---

Given the `head` of a singly linked list where elements are sorted in **ascending order**, convert it to a **height-balanced** binary search tree.

**Example 1:**

    Input: head = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
    Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
    Explanation: One possible answer is [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the shown height balanced BST.

**Example 2:**

    Input: head = []
    Output: []

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in `head` is in the range `[0, 2 * 10^4]`.
* `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
