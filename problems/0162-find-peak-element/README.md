# 0162. Find Peak Element

**Difficulty**: Medium

**Link**: LeetCode 162

---

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞`. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

**Example 1:**

    **Input**: nums = [1,2,3,1]
    **Output**: 2
    **Explanation**: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

**Example 2:**

    **Input**: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
    **Output**: 5
    **Explanation**: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `-2³¹ <= nums[i] <= 2³¹ - 1`
- `nums[i] != nums[i + 1]` for all valid `i`.
