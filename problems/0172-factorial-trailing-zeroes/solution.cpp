        Problem: 0172 - Factorial Trailing Zeroes
        
        Count trailing zeroes in n! without calculating the factorial.
        Trailing zeroes come from factors of 10 = 2 Ã— 5.
        
        Approach:
        - Since there are always more factors of 2 than 5 in factorial, count factors of 5
        - Count multiples of 5: n//5
        - Count multiples of 25 (contribute extra factor): n//25  
        - Count multiples of 125 (contribute extra factor): n//125
        - Continue until n//5^k = 0
        - Total = n//5 + n//25 + n//125 + ...
        
        Time complexity: O(log n).
        Space complexity: O(1).
