# 0224. Basic Calculator

**Difficulty**: Hard

**Link**: [LeetCode 0224](https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator/)

---

Given a string `s` representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return *the result of the evaluation*.

**Note:** You are **not** allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as `eval()`.

**Example 1:**

    **Input:** s = "1 + 1"
    **Output:** 2

**Example 2:**

    **Input:** s = " 2-1 + 2 "
    **Output:** 3

**Example 3:**

    **Input:** s = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
    **Output:** 23

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 3 * 10^5`
* `s` consists of digits, `'+'`, `'-'`, `'('`, `')'`, and `' '`.
* `s` represents a valid expression.
* `'+'` is **not** used as a unary operation (i.e., `"+1"` and `"+(2 + 3)"` is invalid).
* `'-'` could be used as a unary operation (i.e., `"-1"` and `"-(2 + 3)"` is valid).
* There will be no two consecutive operators in the input.
* Every number and running calculation will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.
