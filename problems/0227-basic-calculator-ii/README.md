**Difficulty**: Medium

**Link**: [LeetCode 0227](https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator-ii/)

---

Given a string `s` which represents an expression, *evaluate this expression and return its value*. 

The integer division should truncate toward zero.

You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of `[-2^31, 2^31 - 1]`.

**Note:** You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as `eval()`.

**Example 1:**

    **Input:** s = "3+2*2"
    **Output:** 7

**Example 2:**

    **Input:** s = " 3/2 "
    **Output:** 1

**Example 3:**

    **Input:** s = " 3+5 / 2 "
    **Output:** 5

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 3 * 10^5`
* `s` consists of integers and operators `('+', '-', '*', '/')` separated by some number of spaces.
* `s` represents **a valid expression**.
* All the integers in the expression are non-negative integers in the range `[0, 2^31 - 1]`.
* The answer is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit integer**.
