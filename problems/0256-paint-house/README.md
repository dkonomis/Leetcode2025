# 0256. Paint House

**Difficulty**: Easy  
**Link**: [LeetCode 256](https://leetcode.com/problems/paint-house)

---

There is a row of `n` houses, where each house can be painted one of three colors: red, blue, or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by an `n x 3` cost matrix `costs`.

- For example, `costs[0][0]` is the cost of painting house `0` with the color red; `costs[1][2]` is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on...

Return the minimum cost to paint all houses.

**Example 1:**

    **Input:** costs = [[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]]
    **Output:** 10
    **Explanation:** Paint house 0 into blue, paint house 1 into green, paint house 2 into blue.
    Minimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.

**Example 2:**

    **Input:** costs = [[7,6,2]]
    **Output:** 2

**Constraints:**

- `costs.length == n`
- `costs[i].length == 3`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= costs[i][j] <= 20`
