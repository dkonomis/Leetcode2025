# 0265. Paint House II

**Difficulty**: Hard

**Link**: [LeetCode 265](https://leetcode.com/problems/paint-house-ii/)

---

There are a row of `n` houses, each house can be painted with one of the `k` colors. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by an `n x k` cost matrix `costs`.

For example, `costs[0][0]` is the cost of painting house `0` with color `0`; `costs[1][2]` is the cost of painting house `1` with color `2`, and so on...

Return the minimum cost to paint all houses.

**Example 1:**

    **Input:** costs = [[1,5,3],[2,9,4]]
    **Output:** 5
    **Explanation:** Paint house 0 into color 0, paint house 1 into color 2. Minimum cost: 1 + 4 = 5; 
    Or paint house 0 into color 2, paint house 1 into color 0. Minimum cost: 3 + 2 = 5.

**Example 2:**

    **Input:** costs = [[1,3],[2,4]]
    **Output:** 5

**Constraints:**

* `costs.length == n`
* `costs[i].length == k`
* `1 <= n <= 100`
* `1 <= k <= 20`
* `1 <= costs[i][j] <= 20`
